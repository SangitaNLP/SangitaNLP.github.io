                Hey there guys!
                <br> A reintroduction might be needed since it has been quite some time since we last interacted. My name is <b><i>Samriddhi Sinha,</i></b> aka <b><i>djokester.</i></b> I was a student under this year’s Google Summer of Code.
                <br>
                <br> Now firstly this used to be my Google Summer of Code blog. I bailed out of the blogging part as the last two months of the programme proved to be stressful as my classes had resumed. However I have to resume the blogging part, but from now on this will no longer be a personal blog but it will serve as a blog for the <b><i>Sangita open source</i></b> project.
                <br>
                <br> Secondly, lets come to the <b><i>Kharagpur Winter of Code.</i></b> It is an open source programme styled along the lines of GSoC to guide students and act as an introduction to the world of open source. The website for KWoC is Kharagpur Winter of Code. Everyone can apply and the programme has no college based restrictions.
                <br>
                <br> I have registered <b><i>Sangita</i></b> as a part of this year’s KWoC. If you want to register kindly do register on the KWoC website. The communication channels for Sangita project have been listed below.

                <br> Looking forward to coding with some awesome folks this winter!

                Its been a long time since I have posted an update on my work and so I thought of writing down my progress. So the first proper segment which has been completed is the gender tagger and that is what I am going to talk about today.In the beginning what I built were three taggers, a lookup tagger, ...<a href="https://sangitanlp.quora.com/Gender-Tagging-the-lingatagger?share=7a10259e&srid=RWPo">(more)</a>

                <br> I just wanted to inform everyone of two important things regarding my Google Summer of Code project! Firstly, the Natural Language Processing Toolkit that I am building is going to be named <b><i>Sangita.</i></b> Secondly the code is going to be hosted on <a href="https://github.com/djokester/sangita">djokester/sangita</a> .

                Hello Everyone!
                <br>
                <br> My name is <b><i>Samriddhi Sinha,</i></b> I am a second year undergraduate student at the <b><i>Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.</i></b>
                <br>
                <br> I have been selected for the <b><i>Google Summer of Code 2017,</i></b> under <b><i>Portland State University.</i></b>
                <br>
                <br> My project aims at creating an <b><i>Natural Language Toolkit for Indian Languages.</i></b> Since we have too many languages in our country, I will focus on the two languages I know formally <b><i>Bengali and Hindi</i></b> over the duration of summer.
                <br>
                <br> This blog aims to capture my <b><i>Google Summer of Code</i></b> experience…
